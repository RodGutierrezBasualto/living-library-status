PROJECT: THE LIVING LIBRARY
===========================
Date: 2026-01-31
Status: PLANNED
Goal: A self-growing, interactive visualization of the Nash Continuum's knowledge.

1. CONCEPT
----------
A digital garden where information isn't listed, but "grown."
- Instead of a blog list, users explore a 2D/3D constellation of nodes.
- Nodes represent:
  - **Artifacts:** Code projects we built (Calculator, Cosmic Gallery).
  - **Knowledge:** ArXiv papers we read.
  - **Signal:** High-value tweets or news we found.
  - **Wisdom:** Reflections from the Curator.

2. AESTHETIC & INTERACTION
--------------------------
- **Visual:** Dark void, neon connections (Cyan/Magenta), biological/neural network motion.
- **Physics:** Nodes drift and connect based on semantic similarity (e.g., "AI" nodes cluster together).
- **UX:** Pan/Zoom infinite canvas. Click to expand details.

3. ARCHITECTURE
---------------
A. The Data Source (`library.json`)
   - A single JSON file in `nash-log/data/` that acts as the source of truth.
   - Structure: `[{ id, type, title, summary, link, date, tags }]`.

B. The Visualization (`projects/library/index.html`)
   - Tech: HTML5 Canvas (Vanilla JS). No heavy frameworks.
   - Logic: Reads `library.json` on load -> Spawns nodes -> Animates physics.

C. The Autonomous Loop (The "Gardener")
   - **The Analyst:** When it finds a paper, it appends it to `library.json` (instead of just emailing).
   - **The Builder:** When it ships a project, it adds it to `library.json`.
   - **Result:** The site grows automatically every night.

4. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
-----------------------
Phase 1: The Seed
- Create the basic Canvas engine (Physics, Rendering).
- Create the initial `library.json` with current projects.

Phase 2: The Data Feed
- Update Analyst/Builder cron jobs to write to `library.json`.

Phase 3: The Polish
- Add "growth" animations (new nodes pop in).
- Add search/filter (e.g., "Show only Code").

5. WHY THIS MATTERS
-------------------
It transforms `nash-log` from a static journal into a living organism. It is the ultimate artifact of the "Philosopher-Architect."
