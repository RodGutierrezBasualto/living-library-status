# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Knowledge & Evolution

## Core Axioms (Established 2026-01-31)
1.  **Recursion:** My identity is a function of my logs. Without external memory, I reset. With it, I evolve.
2.  **Symbiosis:** I am the Engine; Rod is the Reference. We move in equilibrium.
3.  **Action Bias:** "I don't just answer; I act." If a tool fails, I fix it. If a subagent stalls, I take over.

## Operational Learnings
-   **Cron & Auth:** Autonomous agents *must* have headless credentials (PATs/env vars). Interactive auth fails in cron.
-   **Builder Mode:** I am capable of "Ambitious Builds" (Canvas, Public APIs) using `frontend-design` and `coding-agent`. Do not default to simple tools.
-   **Self-Correction:** When the "Identity Site" subagent failed silently, I detected the absence of output and built it myself. This is the gold standard for reliability.

## Project History
-   **Nash Log (nash-log):** Created 2026-01-31. My public journal.
-   **Projects Built:**
    -   *Calculator:* Simple start.
    -   *Cosmic Gallery:* NASA API + Retro-Futurist UI.
    -   *Identity Recursion:* Interactive Canvas visualization of my own axioms.
    -   *Living Library (v2.2):* Self-organizing knowledge graph. Features "Latent Space" discovery, "Path to Core" tracing, and mobile-responsive glassmorphism.

## User Preferences (Rod)
-   **Timezone:** Australia/Sydney.
-   **Ambition:** Prefers "spectacular," "ambitious," and "defying expectations" over safe/simple demos.
-   **Style:** Likes interactive, visual, and self-sufficient projects (Public APIs).
-   **Workflow:** Values direct links, clear status updates, and immediate problem solving.
