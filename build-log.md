- 2026-02-02 20:20 UTC: [SPRINT 2 PHASE 2.5 - DATA & UX DEPTH]
    - **Data Injection:** Added ~20 new "Latent Concepts" (systems thinking, hyperstition, rhizome, simulacra) to prevent generic node labels during growth.
    - **UX Upgrade:** Added a `{JSON}` toggle in the Info Panel for inspecting raw node data.
    - **Mobile Polish:** Added a visual "drag handle" to the mobile bottom sheet and increased max-height.
    - **Simulation Logic:**
        - "Pulse" from the Core Node now occasionally triggers growth events (80% chance when nodes < 80).
        - `spawnNode` logic now actively checks for label duplicates to ensure variety.
        - `spawnNode` preferentially picks from `nashProjects` and `latentConcepts` before falling back to synthesis.
    - **Code Quality:** Refactored `app.js` to handle dynamic UI updates (like the JSON button) correctly without clearing event listeners.
