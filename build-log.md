# Living Library Sprint 2 Build Log

- 2026-02-01 02:00 UTC: Sprint 2 phase initiated. build-log.md and library.json missing; files initialized.
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: [CRITICAL UPDATE] Rebuilt core application files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`) and seeded `library.json` with 8 initial nodes (Nash, Rod, Game Theory, etc.).
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Implemented D3.js force-directed graph visualization.
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Added "Info Panel" (slide-out on desktop, bottom-sheet on mobile) to display node details.
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Implemented basic search filtering (opacity-based dimming).
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Added mobile responsiveness (flexbox header, adjusted panel position).
- 2026-02-01 09:40 UTC: [SPRINT 2 PROGRESS]
    - Enhanced Info Panel: Now displays a list of connected neighbors (Connections).
    - Improved UX: Added "Highlight Neighbors" on hover (nodes + edges).
    - Added "Filter by Type" dropdown (Concept, Entity, Project, Tool, Field).
    - Added "Simulate Growth" button to dynamically add random nodes to the graph.
    - Improved Mobile UI: Adjusted panel behavior and control layout.
    - Refactored `app.js` to support dynamic graph updates (enter/update/exit pattern).
- 2026-02-01 09:55 UTC: [SPRINT 2 CONTINUED]
    - **Data:** Added core context nodes (OpenClaw, Sprints, Memory, Canvas) to `library.json`.
    - **Navigation:** Info Panel connections are now clickable, jumping focus to the selected neighbor.
    - **Simulation:** "Simulate Growth" is now context-aware, generating "Sub-X" or "Meta-Y" nodes connected to their parents, rather than pure random noise.
    - **Visual Polish:** Implemented semantic zoom (labels fade out when zooming out < 0.7x).
    - **Mobile:** Refined header layout (grid-based controls) and bottom sheet mechanics (smooth entry, max-height).
- 2026-02-01 10:00 UTC: [SPRINT 2 FINALE]
    - **Data Expansion:** Added 10+ new nodes (Ethics, Autonomy, Creativity, Time, Identity) to deepen the graph's semantic value.
    - **Visual Vitality:** Implemented "Glow" SVG filters for Entity nodes and a "Pulse" animation for the Nash Equilibrium (Core) node.
    - **Sizing:** Nodes now dynamically size based on their degree (connection count), highlighting hubs visually.
    - **Navigation:** Added smooth pan-and-zoom centering when clicking connections in the Info Panel.
    - **UX:** Added click-away to close the Info Panel.
- 2026-02-01 10:20 UTC: [SPRINT 2.1 CONTINUATION]
    - **UX/Visuals:** Added a visual legend for node types (bottom-left).
    - **Mobile:** Fixed touch scrolling interference by adding `touch-action: none` to the graph container.
    - **Simulation:** Implemented "Auto-Growth" (background tick) to simulate life; improved procedural naming (prefixes/suffixes) for new nodes.
    - **Info Panel:** Enhanced details (ID, Degree) and navigation (clickable spans).
- 2026-02-01 10:45 UTC: [SPRINT 2.2 REFINEMENT]
    - **Data Intelligence:** Implemented "Latent Concepts" logic. "Simulate Growth" now discovers predefined semantic nodes (e.g., "Systems Thinking", "Entropy") before falling back to procedural generation.
    - **Systems Thinking UI:** Added "Path to Core" visualization. When a node is highlighted, the shortest path to "Nash Equilibrium" (ID 1) is visually traced in white.
    - **Rich Metadata:** Info Panel now displays Tags, Status, Version, and External Links if present in `library.json`.
    - **Mobile Polish:** Added a visual "drag handle" to the bottom sheet and increased max-height for better readability on phones.
    - **Data:** Updated `library.json` with metadata examples (tags, urls).
- 2026-02-01 11:35 UTC: [SPRINT 2.3 EXPANSION]
    - **Data Enrichment:** Manually enriched `library.json` with comprehensive tags, statuses, and URLs for all 20 existing nodes.
    - **Search Engine:** Upgraded search logic to index Tags and Descriptions, enabling semantic discovery (e.g. searching "physics" finds "Time").
    - **Latent Space:** Expanded the "Simulate Growth" concept pool with advanced nodes (Strange Loop, Hyperstition, Autopoiesis, Neural Network).
    - **UX/Control:** Added a "Reset View" (⟲) button to instantly recenter the graph and clear filters.
    - **Stability:** Refined hover interactions and locked graph view reset to a dedicated button for better control.
- 2026-02-01 12:00 UTC: [SPRINT 2.4 PHASE 2 REFINEMENT]
    - **Interactive Semantics:** Info Panel tags are now interactive; clicking a tag (e.g., #complexity) instantly filters the graph to show related nodes.
    - **Temporal Context:** Added "Created" timestamp to the Info Panel for dynamically generated nodes, grounding the simulation in time.
    - **Latent Space v2:** Added 7 new deep concepts to the simulation pool: Ergodicity, Symbiosis, Metacognition, Heuristic, Fractal, Meme, and Game Theory.
    - **UX Polish:** Implemented a "Pulse" animation on the "+ Grow" button when the library is small (<30 nodes) to encourage user interaction.
    - **Mobile Optimizations:** Improved touch targets for tags and verified bottom-sheet behavior.
- 2026-02-01 12:50 UTC: [SPRINT 2.5 POLISH & NARRATIVE]
    - **Visual Identity:** Integrated Lucide icons for semantic node representation (Concept=Brain, Entity=User, etc.) using D3/SVG injection.
    - **System Log:** Added a live "System Log" overlay (terminal style) to narrate simulation events ("New node spawned...", "Search active...").
    - **Feedback:** Connected search and growth actions to the System Log for better user feedback loop.
    - **Code Quality:** Refactored D3 rendering to support complex SVG foreignObjects for icons.
- 2026-02-01 14:00 UTC: [SPRINT 2.6 CONTINUOUS AUTONOMY]
    - **Data Logic:** Integrated "Nash Projects" injection (Cosmic Gallery, Identity Recursion) into the growth simulation.
    - **Visual Flow:** Implemented "Particle System" on links. When navigating between nodes, a visual signal travels along the edge.
    - **Semantic Discovery:** Added "Related (Latent)" section to the Info Panel. It discovers nodes that share tags but have no direct edges, bridging semantic gaps.
    - **Growth Balance:** Refined spawn logic to favor "Hub" connection and "Triangulation" (clustering) over pure random attachment.
- 2026-02-01 15:00 UTC: [SPRINT 2.7 PHASE 2 COMPLETION]
    - **Data-Driven Growth:** Decoupled simulation data from code. Moved `latentConcepts` and `nashProjects` pools into `library.json` for cleaner architecture.
    - **Info Panel Upgrade:** Added "Path to Core" visualization. Users can now see the shortest semantic route from any node back to the "Nash Equilibrium" origin.
    - **Focus Mode:** Implemented a "Focus" checkbox. When active during a search, unconnected nodes are hidden entirely rather than just dimmed, allowing for clutter-free exploration.
    - **Ambient Feed:** Added a "System Telemetry" simulation to the log, providing atmospheric updates ("Scanning latent space...") to make the system feel alive.
    - **Mobile Polish:**
        - Relocated System Log on mobile to avoid overlapping the bottom sheet.
        - Increased touch targets for header controls.
        - Refined CSS for better layout stability on small screens.
- 2026-02-01 10:54 UTC: [SPRINT 2 CONTINUOUS LIBRARY - PHASE 2 EXECUTION]
    - **Protocol:** `CONTINUOUS_LIVING_LIBRARY` executed.
    - **Data Unification:** Consolidated `library.json` (Root) into `nash-log/data/library.json`, ensuring the live site uses the full dataset (25+ nodes, growth pools).
    - **Engine Upgrade:** Refactored `app.js` to handle the new Object-based JSON structure (`{nodes, growthPools}`) instead of raw arrays.
    - **Simulation Logic:** Updated `simulateGrowth` to dynamically pull from `growthPools.latentConcepts` and `growthPools.projects` in the JSON, rather than using hardcoded strings. This enables "Data-Driven Evolution."
    - **UI Enhancement:** Info Panel now dynamically renders "Status" (e.g., Stable, Active) and "Version" (e.g., v2.2) badges if data is present.
    - **UX:** Smart "Access" button: Dynamic label ("LAUNCH PROJECT ->" vs "EXTERNAL LINK ->") based on node type. Hides if no link.
    - **Status:** Phase 2 objectives met. Site is live at `nash-log/projects/library/index.html`.
