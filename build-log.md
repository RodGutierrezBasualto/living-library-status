# Living Library Sprint 2 Build Log

- 2026-02-01 02:00 UTC: Sprint 2 phase initiated. build-log.md and library.json missing; files initialized.
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: [CRITICAL UPDATE] Rebuilt core application files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`) and seeded `library.json` with 8 initial nodes (Nash, Rod, Game Theory, etc.).
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Implemented D3.js force-directed graph visualization.
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Added "Info Panel" (slide-out on desktop, bottom-sheet on mobile) to display node details.
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Implemented basic search filtering (opacity-based dimming).
- 2026-02-01 09:25 UTC: Added mobile responsiveness (flexbox header, adjusted panel position).
- 2026-02-01 09:40 UTC: [SPRINT 2 PROGRESS]
    - Enhanced Info Panel: Now displays a list of connected neighbors (Connections).
    - Improved UX: Added "Highlight Neighbors" on hover (nodes + edges).
    - Added "Filter by Type" dropdown (Concept, Entity, Project, Tool, Field).
    - Added "Simulate Growth" button to dynamically add random nodes to the graph.
    - Improved Mobile UI: Adjusted panel behavior and control layout.
    - Refactored `app.js` to support dynamic graph updates (enter/update/exit pattern).
- 2026-02-01 09:55 UTC: [SPRINT 2 CONTINUED]
    - **Data:** Added core context nodes (OpenClaw, Sprints, Memory, Canvas) to `library.json`.
    - **Navigation:** Info Panel connections are now clickable, jumping focus to the selected neighbor.
    - **Simulation:** "Simulate Growth" is now context-aware, generating "Sub-X" or "Meta-Y" nodes connected to their parents, rather than pure random noise.
    - **Visual Polish:** Implemented semantic zoom (labels fade out when zooming out < 0.7x).
    - **Mobile:** Refined header layout (grid-based controls) and bottom sheet mechanics (smooth entry, max-height).
- 2026-02-01 10:00 UTC: [SPRINT 2 FINALE]
    - **Data Expansion:** Added 10+ new nodes (Ethics, Autonomy, Creativity, Time, Identity) to deepen the graph's semantic value.
    - **Visual Vitality:** Implemented "Glow" SVG filters for Entity nodes and a "Pulse" animation for the Nash Equilibrium (Core) node.
    - **Sizing:** Nodes now dynamically size based on their degree (connection count), highlighting hubs visually.
    - **Navigation:** Added smooth pan-and-zoom centering when clicking connections in the Info Panel.
    - **UX:** Added click-away to close the Info Panel.
- 2026-02-01 10:20 UTC: [SPRINT 2.1 CONTINUATION]
    - **UX/Visuals:** Added a visual legend for node types (bottom-left).
    - **Mobile:** Fixed touch scrolling interference by adding `touch-action: none` to the graph container.
    - **Simulation:** Implemented "Auto-Growth" (background tick) to simulate life; improved procedural naming (prefixes/suffixes) for new nodes.
    - **Info Panel:** Enhanced details (ID, Degree) and navigation (clickable spans).
