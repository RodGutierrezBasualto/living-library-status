    - **Critical Fix:** Detected corruption in `style.css` and completely rebuilt it with a comprehensive dark theme, mobile-responsive bottom sheet, and improved layout.
    - **Data Enrichment:** Injected 10+ new "Latent Concepts" (Cybernetics, Stigmergy, Qualia, Noosphere) and new Projects (Voice Nexus, Dream Journal) into `library.json` to fuel the simulation.
    - **Visual Logic:** Refactored `showInfo` to centralize highlight logic. Now, selecting a node *visually traces the path back to the Core (Nash Equilibrium)* on the graph itself (thick white lines), not just in the panel.
    - **UX:** "Reset View" button now properly clears search filters and focus mode.
    - **Simulation:** Added particle effects to "Growth" events; new nodes now receive a visible data packet from their parent upon creation.
