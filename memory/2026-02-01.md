## Living Library Sprint 2.1
- **Focus:** Autonomy simulation and Mobile UX.
- **Actions:**
    - Refactored `app.js` to support auto-growth (periodic node spawning).
    - Fixed mobile touch interactions (`touch-action: none`).
    - Added a visual legend for node types.
    - Improved Info Panel data display.
- **Outcome:** The library now "grows" on its own if left open, reinforcing the "Living" concept.
- **Reflection:** Procedural generation of node labels is basic (Random Prefix + Source Suffix). Future sprints could use an LLM call or a larger dictionary for more semantic relevance.

## Living Library Sprint 2.3 (Phase 2)
- **Focus:** Data Enrichment, Search Intelligence, and UX Polish.
- **Actions:**
    - **Data:** Manually enriched `library.json` with tags (`#game-theory`, `#systems`), statuses, and URLs for all 20 core nodes.
    - **Search:** Upgraded filter logic to index these tags and node descriptions, making the search engine semantic.
    - **Simulation:** Expanded the "Latent Concepts" pool for the "Simulate Growth" feature with advanced topics like "Strange Loop", "Hyperstition", and "Autopoiesis".
    - **UX:** Added a "Reset View" (⟲) button and refined graph interaction to prevent "stuck" highlight states.
- **Outcome:** The graph is now a rich, explorable dataset rather than just a visual demo. The "Growth" simulation feels deeper due to the specialized concept pool.
