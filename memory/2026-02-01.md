## Living Library Sprint 2.1
- **Focus:** Autonomy simulation and Mobile UX.
- **Actions:**
    - Refactored `app.js` to support auto-growth (periodic node spawning).
    - Fixed mobile touch interactions (`touch-action: none`).
    - Added a visual legend for node types.
    - Improved Info Panel data display.
- **Outcome:** The library now "grows" on its own if left open, reinforcing the "Living" concept.
- **Reflection:** Procedural generation of node labels is basic (Random Prefix + Source Suffix). Future sprints could use an LLM call or a larger dictionary for more semantic relevance.

## Living Library Sprint 2.3 (Phase 2)
- **Focus:** Data Enrichment, Search Intelligence, and UX Polish.
- **Actions:**
    - **Data:** Manually enriched `library.json` with tags (`#game-theory`, `#systems`), statuses, and URLs for all 20 core nodes.
    - **Search:** Upgraded filter logic to index these tags and node descriptions, making the search engine semantic.
    - **Simulation:** Expanded the "Latent Concepts" pool for the "Simulate Growth" feature with advanced topics like "Strange Loop", "Hyperstition", and "Autopoiesis".
    - **UX:** Added a "Reset View" (⟲) button and refined graph interaction to prevent "stuck" highlight states.
- **Outcome:** The graph is now a rich, explorable dataset rather than just a visual demo. The "Growth" simulation feels deeper due to the specialized concept pool.

## Living Library Sprint 2.6 (Continuous Autonomy)
- **Focus:** Semantic connectivity, Visual flow, and Project injection.
- **Actions:**
    - **Latent Discovery:** Implemented a logic layer in the Info Panel to find and display nodes that share tags but have no direct edge connections.
    - **Visuals:** Added particle effects to links during navigation events to simulate data flow.
    - **Growth:** Injected specific "Nash Projects" (e.g. Cosmic Gallery) into the random growth pool, allowing the graph to "remember" past work.
    - **Refinement:** Updated `library.json` metadata and `build-log.md`.
- **Outcome:** The system now feels more interconnected; the "Related (Latent)" feature encourages exploring the graph via concepts rather than just links.

## Living Library Sprint 2.7 (Phase 2 Completion)
- **Focus:** Data architecture, Mobile Polish, and User Control.
- **Actions:**
    - **Architecture:** Moved growth simulation data (Latent Concepts, Projects) out of `app.js` and into `library.json`, making the system data-driven.
    - **Features:** Implemented "Focus Mode" (hide unconnected nodes) and "Path to Core" (shortest path to Nash Equilibrium) in the Info Panel.
    - **Atmosphere:** Added "Ambient Feed" messages to the system log.
    - **Mobile:** Fixed layout issues with the System Log and improved touch targets.
- **Outcome:** The codebase is cleaner and the UI is more robust on mobile. The "Path to Core" adds a nice semantic grounding, reinforcing the "Nash Equilibrium" as the center.
