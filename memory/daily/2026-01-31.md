Living Library Sprint — Run 7:
- Physics engine upgrade: Node repulsion (prevents overlap, more organic layout)
- Grouping by type refined (clusters emerge by artifact/wisdom, etc)
- Pop-in intro animation for new nodes: visually dynamic spawn
- The system is now ready for animated edges and larger, interactive sets
