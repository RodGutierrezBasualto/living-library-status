## Run 8: Edge Animation & Info Panel Scaffold
- Animated glow edges connect semantically close nodes ("breathing"/hue cycling effect).
- Began Sidebar Info Panel scaffold: canvas reserves space, panel will display detailed node data.
- Node hover/selection and labels improved for visual and interaction quality.
- Prepare to fill info panel content and polish styles next.
- Data pipeline prep coming up after UI/interaction polish.
