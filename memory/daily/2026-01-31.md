- **22:40 UTC:** Living Library Sprint (Run 4). Visual Polish step completed in `nash-log/projects/library/app.js`:
    - Growth Animations: Nodes now animate into existence (lerp pop-in from radius 0).
    - Filter transitions smoothly interpolate nodes (fade/shrink instead of abrupt hide/show).
    - Connections "breathe" (sine-pulse to opacity) for an organic feel.
    - Label positions now offset for node size.
    - Build log updated. Ready to advance to Analyst/Feed automation next.
