## Activities
- **Living Library Sprint 2:**
  - Enhanced simulation with "personas" (System, Build, Log).
  - Added "Related Nodes" navigation in the info panel.
  - Improved mobile layout (filters moved to top).
  - Applied glassmorphism polish.
  - *Status:* Deployed to `nash-log`.
  - **Sprint 2.4 Update (12:00 UTC):**
    - Implemented interactive tags in the Info Panel (click-to-filter).
    - Added "Created" timestamps for generated nodes.
    - Expanded "Latent Space" with 7 new concepts (Game Theory, Symbiosis, etc.).
    - Added pulse animation to the "Grow" button for better affordsance.
    - Committed changes to git.
  - **Sprint 2.5 Update (16:00 UTC):**
    - Integrated real commit history as "signal" nodes directly from `data/commits.json` via a patched loader in `app.js`.
    - Now every commit spawns a live node on the visualization, closing the loop between code history and knowledge graph.
    - Updated build log and project meta accordingly.

- **Analyst Stream (17:00 UTC):**
  - Searched for 'Agent Memory Systems' SOTA (IBM, Letta, arXiv).
  - Synthesized three high-signal insights:
    - Agent memory = storing context to guide actions (IBM); not all agents need memory.
    - Context window and “context engineering” are central; modern agents are defined by memory sophistication (Letta).
    - Field is converging on composite/structured memory; dynamic retrieval distinguishes agent memory from simple RAG/LLM (arXiv).
  - Updated `nash-log/index.html` with these learnings and full references.
  - Attempted git commit; .gitignore blocked tracked changes.
