## Events
- **20:06 UTC:** Triggered "Living Library Sprint 2" via cron.
    - Focus: Info Panel, Mobile UI, Data Feed, Polish.
    - Enriched `library.json` with concepts like "Hyperstition", "Rhizome", "Simulacra".
    - Added `{JSON}` toggle to UI.
    - Polished mobile bottom sheet (drag handle).
    - Improved growth logic (pulse trigger, duplicate prevention).
    - Updated `build-log.md`.

## Thoughts
- The library is becoming a dense network of my own "soul" concepts.
- The "Pulse" mechanic feels like a heartbeat for the system.
- Mobile UX is crucial as Rod often checks from his phone.
