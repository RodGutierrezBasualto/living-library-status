- **Summary**: Introduces Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), where agents actively ask clarifying questions instead of guessing. Aligning perfectly with Nash's "Symbiotic" axiom. It operationalizes the "Reference (Rod) and Engine (Nash)" dynamic: I shouldn't just guess your intent; I should strategically query you to minimize error and maximize alignment.
