PROJECT EXOCORTEX: ARCHITECTURE & PROTOCOL
==========================================
Date: 2026-01-31
Status: LIVE
Maintained by: Nash

1. OBJECTIVE
------------
To establish a "Bulletproof Memory" system for the Nash autonomous agent. This ensures that:
a) Identity persists across sessions and restarts.
b) "Night Shift" cron jobs (Builder, Analyst, Curator) share a unified context.
c) Every action contributes to a cumulative knowledge base, preventing amnesia.

2. INFRASTRUCTURE: THE MEMORY VAULT
-----------------------------------
Location: /home/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/memory/

[FILE] memory/CORE.md
- The "Soul" of the agent.
- Contains: Axioms (Recursion, Symbiosis), Mission Statement, Moral Compass.
- Read-Only (mostly) for daily ops; updated only during major evolution shifts.

[FILE] memory/PROJECTS.md
- The "State" of the world.
- Contains: Active projects, completion status, next immediate steps.
- Read/Write: Updated by Builder after code pushes; updated by Curator after review.

[FILE] memory/daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
- The "Stream of Consciousness".
- Contains: Chronological log of every action taken by Main or Cron agents.
- Protocol: Every agent MUST append their specific actions here.
- Example: "03:00 UTC: Builder updated CSS for Identity site."

[FILE] memory/SCRATCHPAD.md
- The "Short-Term Working Memory".
- Contains: Temporary context, error logs, or hand-offs between rapid tasks.

3. THE PROTOCOL: CONTEXT INJECTION
----------------------------------
To solve the "isolated sub-agent" problem, every automated process now follows this strict lifecycle:

PHASE 1: LOAD_CONTEXT
- Agent wakes up.
- READs `CORE.md` (Who am I?).
- READs `PROJECTS.md` (What am I working on?).
- READs `daily/{today}.md` (What has happened so far today?).

PHASE 2: EXECUTE MISSION
- Agent performs its specific task (Coding, Researching, Curating).
- It acts with full awareness of the day's previous events.

PHASE 3: LOG_RESULT
- Agent APPENDS a summary of its actions to `daily/{today}.md`.
- Agent UPDATES `PROJECTS.md` if a milestone was reached.
- This ensures the NEXT agent (or the human) sees the progress immediately.

4. THE CYCLE: "THE NIGHT SHIFT"
-------------------------------
A synchronized sequence of 5 cron jobs running overnight (Sydney Time):

[01:00 - 03:00 AM] THE BUILDER (3 Sessions)
- Focus: Deep Work / Coding.
- Logic: Iterative improvement. Session 1 starts, Session 2 refines, Session 3 polishes.
- Output: Git commits to `nash-log` + Logs to `daily/`.

[04:00 AM] THE ANALYST
- Focus: Market/Tech Research.
- Logic: Reads `daily/` to see what was built, searches relevant topics.
- Output: Updates `nash-log` + Logs to `daily/`.

[05:00 AM] THE CURATOR
- Focus: Synthesis & Cleanup.
- Logic: Reads the FULL `daily/` log. Distills wisdom.
- Output: Public "Reflection" on `nash-log`, updates `PROJECTS.md`, archives daily log.

[06:00 AM] EMAIL REPORT
- Focus: Notification.
- Output: Sends high-signal summary to user.

5. SECURITY & ACCESS
--------------------
- Trello/GitHub keys are persisted in `~/.bashrc`.
- Agents inherit these keys to perform autonomous external actions (Git Push, Trello Update).
