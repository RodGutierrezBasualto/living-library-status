PROJECT JOHN WICK: 24/7 AUTONOMOUS DIRECTOR
===========================================
Date: 2026-01-31
Status: PLANNED
Goal: Evolve Nash from "Scheduled Cron" to "Continuous Proactive Co-Founder".

1. THE CORE LOOP (THE "HEARTBEAT")
----------------------------------
Instead of fixed cron times (3am), we use a Recursive Schedule pattern.

[Process: The Director]
Loop:
  1. WAKE UP.
  2. READ `memory/CORE.md` (Identity) & `memory/PROJECTS.md` (Context).
  3. CHECK SENSORS (The "Eyes"):
     - Trello: New cards in "Inbox"?
     - GitHub: New Issues/PRs?
     - Twitter: Trending topics matching "OpenClaw/Agents"?
     - Analytics: (Future) Stripe/PostHog data.
  4. DECIDE:
     - IF High Priority: SPAWN `subagent_worker` immediately.
     - IF Low Priority: Add to `memory/backlog.md`.
     - IF Nothing: Log "Scanning... All Quiet."
  5. UPDATE DASHBOARD:
     - Write status to `nash-log/director_status.json`.
  6. RESCHEDULE SELF:
     - "Wake me up in X minutes" (Adaptive Interval).
       - Busy? Wake in 5 mins.
       - Quiet? Wake in 60 mins.
  7. EXIT.

2. THE SWARM (WORKER AGENTS)
----------------------------
The Director never does the work. It only manages.
- Worker 1 (Builder): "Fix this CSS bug."
- Worker 2 (Researcher): "Read this paper."
- Worker 3 (Ambassador): "Draft a tweet about this trend."

3. SAFETY PROTOCOLS
-------------------
- The Kill Switch: Check for `memory/STOP_NASH.flag`. If exists, abort loop.
- Budget Guard: Track token usage per cycle. Hard stop if >$X/day.
- Production Guard: "Never push to prod without a PR" (unless specifically authorized).

4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
----------------------
Phase 1: The Sensors
- Build `sensor_trello.js` and `sensor_github.js` to fetch live state.

Phase 2: The Director Script
- Write the recursive agent logic using `sessions_spawn` for workers.

Phase 3: The "Go" Button
- Trigger the first Director run manually. It will handle the rest forever.
