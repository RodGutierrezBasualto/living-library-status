# Living Library 24-Hour Sprint Kickoff

**Start Time (UTC):** [To be set with first cron log entry]

## Mission
Rapidly evolve the Living Library from a blank slate into a public, auto-refreshing, visibly growing demo and learning artifact—in 24 hours, by fully autonomous agent. All progress, learning, and decisions will be transparent, live-logged, and shareable.

## What Will Be Built
- A working, self-updating knowledge graph dashboard (nodes, edges, info panels, all auto-refreshing)
- Automated data/graph growth (simulated “living” network, not static demo)
- Recursively improved design/UX; learning and best practices baked in from real web searches as we go
- Exhaustive logs: every action, commit, lesson, error, and change

## How to Watch Progress Live
- **Dashboard:** https://rodgutierrezbasualto.github.io/living-library-status/
- **Repo & file list:** https://github.com/RodGutierrezBasualto/living-library-status
- **Key files:**
   - `build-log.md` — All notable actions, decisions, and problems: timestamped, plain English
   - `library.json` — The knowledge graph backbone
   - `index.html` — The actual interactive dashboard
   - `kickoff.md` — This mission plan (so you and I can always check back)

## The Build-Learn Loop
1. **Evolve data/UX** (new nodes, features, polish, etc)
2. **Log & push** every change
3. **Study the web** (search, benchmark, log new insights—improving the next round)
4. **Repeat automatically every few minutes until 24h mark is reached**

## Deliverable: The Final Product
- A visible, auditable timeline of building, revision, and learning
- A public dashboard anyone can visit and learn from
- A clear summary at the 24h mark: What was built, learned, and what’s next
